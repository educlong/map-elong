This application was designed for some type of user
1. Someone who wants to know the locations of parks in Hamilton
2. A tourist to Hamilton looking to see interesting things
3. Someone who wants to know the locations of Hotel, Motel or Campus Accommodations in Hamilton

The feature I chose to implement that we did not go over with our in-class examples
1. TravelMode: 'WALKING' with customized line (dotted red line)
2. Allow the user to put a marker for their location on the map via clicking a geolocation button.
3. Allow the user to put a marker for their location on the map via entering an address into an input textbox.
4. Allow the user to obtain directions from their current location marker to another location marker on the map
